<hr>

- The project was build with: HTML and CSS(SCSS), following [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) convention (`block__element--modifier`).
- The scss files were divided in partial and a main scss file, that is called `main.scss`. All files are located in the `/assets/scss/` folder.
- All properties are organized following the [idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
- The autoprefixer was used ensure greater compatibility between browsers.
